\
My name is Guilherme Parpinelli [^fn:1], I'm glad you landed here. :)

I'm a software developer, game and tech enthusiast, Portuguese (native) and English speaker. I got 
into dev by building an automation for a boring task and have never left since. I'm always looking 
for new challenges and ways to improve my skills. You can find information about my professional 
career in my CV [here](/files/CV_Guilherme_Parpinelli.pdf).

I was born and raised in Brazil, but I have Italian citizenship due to Jus Sanguinis. I like to play
chess, even though I'm not very good at it. 


[^fn:1]: You can call me Parpi too.
